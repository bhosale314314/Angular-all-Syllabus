Custom Pipes:

If user want to implement businness logic on perticular data through out the application 
then we can write our business logic at common point i.e. inside custom pipe and can call anywhere in the application.
Custom pipe will take arguments as an array with the help of rest operator.

	{{data | custPipeName : arguments }}

Angular ===> aNgUlAr ===> home work.
Angular ===> ralugnA ===> home work.


Custom Directive:
There are two types of directives i.e. attribute directives and structural directives.
We can build our own diretive to implement logic based on business requirement.
can create custom directive with the help of command: ng g d dirName


<div dirName>
</div>

Constructor:
It is resposible for object creation of the class. 
It is also resposible for dependency injection i.e. depend on something else.
It is not a part of angular life cycle.
It is  not compulsory to write constructor, if we dont write angular will invoke it by default.


Angular Life Cycle methods /hooks:

Angular component consists of 8 lifecycle hooks/ methods.
Depend on each state all the methods are going to call.
constructor is not a part of angular lifecycle and constructor will call before lifecycle came into picture.

1) onChanges():

2) onInit():

3) doCheck(): 

4) afterContentInit():

5) afterContentCheck():

6) afterViewinit():

7) afterViewCheck() :

8) ngDestroy():
