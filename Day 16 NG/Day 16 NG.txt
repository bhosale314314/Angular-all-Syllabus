Intercomponent communication :

Intercomponent communication is used to send the data from one comp to another comp.
It might be parent or child or sibling or unrelated comp.

If it is parent to child communication the we can pass or get the data by three ways i.e.
	@Input, @Output, @ViewChild
	
	1. @Input :
		It is a decorator used to send the data from parent to child.
		It uses attribute or property binding.
		
	2. @Output:
		It is a decorator used to send the data from child to parent.
		It uses event binding.
		It uses custom events using event emitter.
		
	3.  @ViewChild:
		Used to send the data from child to parent.
		with the help of viewchild we can take complete control of child comp inside parent.
		we can call methods and properties of child comp inside only ngAfterViewInit of parent comp.
