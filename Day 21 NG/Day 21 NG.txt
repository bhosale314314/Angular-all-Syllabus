Angular Test cases:

benefits:
	1. Code rectoring means functionalitywise testing.
	2. Chnaces of less errors through out the application.
	3. If you are adding new features then will easily understand our application is breaking or not.
	
	To write test cases in angular we require two things:
	1. Jasmine: It is an third party library. Using jasmine we can write test cases.
	2. karma: It is a runner which will help to run the test cases.
	
	To test our test cases we have commond: ng test
	To see how much test cases we have covered : ng test --code-coverage
