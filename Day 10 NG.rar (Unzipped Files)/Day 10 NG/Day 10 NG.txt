Dependency Injection:
It is a pattern of class coding in which class recieves its dependencies externally rather than creating itself.


HTTP Client: 

HttpClient is a built in service used to communicate with backend.
It is also used for sending the http request and get the response.
We will get the reposonse of http request in terms of observable.

Htpp provides us below methods.

get ----> Used to get the data from the backend.

post ---> This method can perform functionality of all above methods.

Observables are asynchronous or parellal flow of execution which can handle multiple events at a time.
Observables are not from core angular librabries, it came from RxJs.
Observables can handle three events:
