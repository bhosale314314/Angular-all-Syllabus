** Basic Building Blocks of the Angular.

1. Modules
2. Component
3. Template
4. Decorator/ Metadata
5. Service
6. Dependency Injection
7. Data Bidnding.

1. Modules:
	Module has came into picture from ES6.
	Module consist of classes, import, export, providers, bootstrap.
	There are two types of modules. i.e root module and feature module.
	We can change our root module  from main.ts. 
	We can create feature module with command : ng generate module exam / ng g m exam.
	Root module is reposible for creating feature module or another modules.
	app module is my root module of the angular project.
	
2. Component:
	Compelete angular is based component architecture.
	component is collection of class, template and decorator.
	Decorator tells to angular, how to process on the class.
	comp have four files===>
	comp.css ====> includes css code.
	comp.html ====> includes html code.
	comp.spec.ts ===> includes test cases.
	comp.ts ====> class file. It is main file of the comp. 
	
	compo class consist of methods  and properties.
	* Every angular project has atleast one root component and can have zero or multiple feature component.
	app comp is my root component.
	We can create feature component with the help of command: ng generate component componentName / ng g c student.
	Every comp has their own selector. 
	With the help of selector I can call the component.
	
	Every angular project has atleast one root module, one root component and we can have zero or multiple feature module as well as component.
	
	** Every angular porject can have multiple root components.
