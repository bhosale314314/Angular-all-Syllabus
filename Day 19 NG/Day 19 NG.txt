Angular Deployment:

Deployment consist of two processes/parts:
1. Transpilation: converting TS code JS code.
2. compilation : Converting JS code into mininfied JS code.

Angular provides both process into a single commond i.e. ng build


Angular provides two types of compilation i.e AOT and JIT.

JIT: Just In time compiler. The application compiles inside the browser during the runtime.
	If we chnage small piece of code then complete application is going to compile once again.
	JIT compiler has been removed from angular 12 version.
	
AOT: Ahead of Time compiler. This compiler compiles the application during the build time.
	If we chnage in  particular piece of code then only that part of the code will be compiled once again not the complete angular code.
	From angular 13, AOT is used as default compiler.
	
	Benefits of AOT:
	1. Faster reneding/ minimum loading time.
	2. Less API calls.
	3. Minimizing the errors.
	4. Better security.
